# Project Blueprint

## 1. Overview

This project is a full-stack Laravel application designed for lead generation and management. It includes features for managing businesses and leads, with functionality for scraping data, sending outreach emails, and tracking lead status.

## 2. Style, Design, and Features

### 2.1. Initial Version

*   **Backend:** Laravel framework with MVC architecture.
*   **Frontend:** Default Laravel Blade views with Tailwind CSS.
*   **Authentication:** Standard Laravel authentication scaffolding (login, registration).
*   **Core Features:**
    *   Business and Lead CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    *   Data scraping capabilities.
    *   Outreach and follow-up email functionality.

## 3. Current Task: UI/UX Improvement

### 3.1. Plan

1.  **Analyze Existing Frontend:** Review the current Blade templates (`welcome.blade.php`, `login.blade.php`, `register.blade.php`, and dashboard layouts) to identify areas for improvement.
2.  **Redesign Core Pages:** Create new, modern designs for the main pages of the application, focusing on:
    *   **Visual Appeal:** Implementing a consistent and visually appealing design with a modern color palette, typography, and spacing.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Ensuring the layout is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
    *   **User Experience:** Improving the usability of forms and navigation.
3.  **Implement New Designs:** Update the Blade templates with the new Tailwind CSS components and layouts.
4.  **Iterate and Refine:** Continuously check for visual and runtime errors and refine the design based on feedback.

### 3.2. First Step: Redesign the Welcome Page

The first step is to redesign the public-facing `welcome.blade.php` to create a great first impression. I will replace the default Laravel welcome page with a modern, professional-looking landing page.
