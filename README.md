## 🗄️ Database Migration

#### 1. Create the Database File

This project uses SQLite by default. If you are using it, create the database file:

```

#### 2. Run Migrations & Seeders

Run the database migrations to create the tables and seed them with default data, including the admin user:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

## 🏃‍♀️ How to Run Locally

To run the application, you need to start both the PHP server and the Vite development server in separate terminals.

#### 1. Start the Laravel Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

#### 2. Start the Vite Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🔑 Admin Access

A default administrator account is created when the database is seeded.

-   **Email:** `admin@example.com`
-   **Password:** `password`

Log in with these credentials to access the admin dashboard and manage all users and leads.
